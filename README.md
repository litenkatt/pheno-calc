# PhenoAge explorer

The PhenoAge explorer is a responsive React-based tool that estimates biological age using Levine’s 2018 model. Built with Material UI and React Hook Form, it allows users to enter common blood biomarkers and automatically calculates their Phenotypic Age, as well as the difference from chronological age.

Each biomarker input is equipped with an intuitive slider alongside the numeric field, allowing users to effortlessly adjust values and see in real time how those changes would affect their biological age. This makes the tool not just a calculator, but also an exploratory environment where users can experiment with hypothetical improvements—like lowering CRP or increasing albumin—to better understand what factors most influence their aging trajectory.
